  On June 2023 Rahul Rimal contacted Rinho and myself regarding the analysis of vascularized spheroids. The project contains two experimental conditions: a) Control Vascularized spheroids and b) Vascularized spheroids with Microgels. It was observed that addition of Microgels improves vascularization significantly. They would like to confirm this behavior based on the visual results acquired with sequencing data.

## Introduction

In the First email Rahul send he wrote:

```
For my project, I am also interested in conducting the sequencing and would be grateful to have your expertise. I am currently working with vascularized spheroids and have two experimental conditions:

a) Control Vascularized spheroids 
b) Vascularized spheroids with Microgels 

We have observed that addition of Microgels improves vascularization significantly and would like to confirm the visual results we acquired with the sequencing data. 
 
I am in the process of preparing/extracting RNA from 3 technical and 3 biological replicates of each above mentioned conditions. Therefore, a total of 18 samples. 
Each sample contain 300 vascularized spheroids (roughly a million cells per sample). 

I would like to know whether sequencing of these samples is feasible for you and your schedule. Do let me know which month/date could be the most suitable for you to receive the samples (depending on your schedule).
```

So, we have a 3x3 experimental design for two conditions. 











```{r}
eruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)
n_eruptions <- length(eruptions)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma
#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.
#| fig-height: 1.5
#| fig-width: 6
par(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)
plot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), 
  pch = "|", axes = FALSE)
axis(1)
box()
```

```{r}
#| output: false
avg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))
avg_years_between_eruptions
```

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `r round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
